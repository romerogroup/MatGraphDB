# Calculations Module for MatGraphDB

Welcome to the `calculations` module of the MatGraphDB package. This module is dedicated to performing and managing various types of calculations essential for analyzing material properties and interactions. It is structured into two primary subdirectories, each specializing in a distinct type of calculation relevant to material science research.

## Module Structure

The `calculations` module is organized into the following subdirectories:

- **`mat_calcs`**: Focuses on material-specific calculations that are pivotal for understanding and predicting material properties and behaviors. This includes bonding calculations, chemenv calculations, similarity calculations, and more. The goal of these calculations is to provide insights into the material's structural, chemical, and physical properties from a theoretical or empirical perspective.

- **`dft_calcs`**: Dedicated to Density Functional Theory (DFT) calculations. DFT is a quantum mechanical modeling method used in physics and chemistry to investigate the electronic structure (principally the ground state) of many-body systems, especially atoms, molecules, and the condensed phases. This directory contains scripts and utilities for setting up, running, and analyzing DFT calculations, focusing on materials science applications.

## Purpose

The `calculations` module is designed to serve as a comprehensive toolkit for conducting advanced material analyses within the MatGraphDB framework. By segregating the calculation tools into material-specific (`mat_calcs`) and DFT-focused (`dft_calcs`) categories, the module ensures a structured approach to material research, enabling users to apply the most appropriate computational techniques for their specific needs.

Whether you are looking to explore new material properties, validate theoretical models, or conduct in-depth material analyses, the `calculations` module provides the necessary computational tools and frameworks to support your research.

## Getting Started

To begin using the `calculations` module:

1. Ensure you have MatGraphDB and its dependencies properly installed.
2. Familiarize yourself with the specific functions and utilities available within the `mat_calcs` and `dft_calcs` directories. Each subdirectory contains a set of scripts designed for specific types of calculations.
3. Consult the documentation and example scripts provided within each subdirectory to understand the input requirements, execution process, and output interpretation for each type of calculation.

## Contribution

We welcome contributions to the `calculations` module, including enhancements to existing calculation scripts, addition of new calculation types, and improvements to documentation. If you're interested in contributing, please review our contribution guidelines and submit your pull requests or issues through our repository's issue tracker.
