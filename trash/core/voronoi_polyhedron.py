    A class to represent a Voronoi polyhedron; similar in many respects to
    coxeter's ConvexPolyhedron, and hence inheriting from it, but extended
    in some useful ways for the analysis of Voronoi polyhedra that we will
    need.

    Beyond the functionality already provided by coxeter's ConvexPolyhedron,
    this class provides a chemical species identifying the type of atom that
    the polyhedron is associated with, as well as an ordered list of facets
    in increasing order of their areas. In principle it is possible to have
    facets of the same shape (e.g. triangles) with different areas, so two
    lists are provided: one for the areas and one for the number of vertices
    of the corresponding facet.
